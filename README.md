# 5G_ciphered_NAS_decipher_tool
  A python tool to decipher/decrypt 5G ciphered NAS message and export plain 5G NAS into wireshark pcap file
  During my work in 5G testing and troubleshooting, I have been seeing many cases that 5G NAS message captured in wireshark are ciphered by AES,snow3G, or ZUC, and the SUCI in registration request could also be ciphered by profileA/profileB defined in 3gPP 33.501.
So I come up with this idea to write a python program to decipher the 5G NAS payload retrieved from pcap file, then write the plain NAS payload back into the pcap file. By that, we can browse and check the deciphered NAS details by wireshark very easily.

# Supported ciphering algorithm:
  a.	SUCI encryption based on profile A(curve 22519)  or profile B( EC secp256r1)
  
  b.	NAS ciphering with EEA1(snow3G)/EEA2(AES)/EEA3(ZUC)
# Current limitation:
  Support 5G AKA authentication only, no EAP-AKA’ support.
# Environment/Versions
  wireshark 3.0+ on windows 7/10.
# The basic idea of how to decipher the 5G NAS message:
  3GPP TS 33.501 Annex C defines Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) to conceal the Subscription Permanent Identifier(SUPI) in registration request. The encrption of ECIES profileA or profileB is based on below diagram, so if we have the private key of home network, and retreive the Eph. public key of UE in regisration request message from pcap file,then we can compute the Eph. shared key based on the private key of home network and Eph. public key of UE. With the Eph. shared key computed, we can derive Eph. decription key to decrypt the SUCI and get the plain text based SUPI.
  Encryption of SUPI based on ECIES:

  Further more, after getting SUPI,if we have the secret key of UE and OP(or OPc) of network,we can retrieve the RAND/MAC/RES value from authentication request in pcap file, then compute the CK/IK based on Milenage algorithm(3GPP 35.205/35.206) on our own. With the CK/IK and below key derivation scheme defined in 3GPP 33.501, we can eventually derive the KAMF and the subsquent KNASenc key to decipher the NAS payload.
  Key derivation scheme defined by 33.501, based on which we could compute the Eph. shared key and encryption key for SUCI decryption.

  5G AKA authentication procedure defined by 33.501, from which we could retrieve the RAND value and compute CK/IK and eventually get the encryption key of NAS to decrypt NAS payload.

  An alternative way to derive KAMF and KNASenc key is to capture the message between AUSF and SEAF, then derive the Kseaf from message, by that, we can eventually derive the KAMF & KNASenc without having to get the secret key and OP value,as usually secret key and OP are quite confidential and won't be exposed to outside user. This tool currently support deriving the encryption key based on secret key and OP only, as it's supposed to use for internal testing so it's shouldn't be a problem to get secret key and OP, it may support derive encription key based on Kseaf capture between AUSF and SEAF(AMF).
  
  With the encryption key derived, we can decrypt the NAS payload based on below scheme of ciphering-data defined in 33.401 Annex B.

# Prerequisite needed to make this tool work:
  1.	Your pcap need to contain the registration request or identity response message from UEs so that the tool could retrieve the SUPI from that, the pcap need to contain authentication request message as well so that the tool could retrieve the CK/IK based on the rand value during authentication procedure.
  
  2.	Running on windows 7/10 only.
  
  3.	Wireshark 3.0 or above installed on the computer on which this tool is running, as tshark of wireshark is needed to read the pcap file. Old wireshark(lower than 3.0) may not decode new 5G nas message well.
  
 # how to use this tool:
  1. In your wireshak,make sure you have the option “edit->preference->try to detect and decode EEA0 ciphered messages” enabled in     wireshark, so that it would decode  and display the “null encrypted message” generated by this tool.

  2. Run the python code on your windows PC.
  
  3. Input the secret key and op in GUI, to decrypt ciphered NAS. If your SUPI is encrypted, you need to input private key to allow the tool decrypt SUCI and retrieve the SUPI for NAS encryption key computation.

  4. Select the .pcap file, then click “decrypt”, the tool will filter it by ngap protocol first, then generate a new pcap file with decrypted message content inside, the encrypted nas message inside pcap would be replace by new plain message.
  5. After that, open the new .pcap file by wireshark, you’ll see the plain 5G nas message inside. Also, the SUCI in the first registration message would be decrypted and replaced by a plain SUPI string with the “null scheme” format in spec and BCD based encoding , padded by all ‘ff’ to keep the original length of the message unchanged, otherwise, it may cause checksum error in other layer.
